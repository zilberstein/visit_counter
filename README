Visitor Counter


OVERVIEW
-----------------------
My website keeps track of 5 different pieces of information about its users.
It counts how many times the page has been used, how many unique people have
visited the site, which operating systems the users are running, which browsers
they use, and what language their computer is configured in.  The last 3 are
plotted on graphs broken down by percent.

IMPLEMENTATION
-----------------------
The main part of the site is run from index.php.  When a user visits the site,
index.php calls a python script, update_data.  It gives as input to the python
script the user's IP address, operating system, web browser, and language.  The
IP address is used to determine if the user has been to the site before.  If
the IP address is not reckognized, it increments the number of unique visitors
and adds the IP address to a list of known IPs.  All the data about users is
stored in a JSON file.  After update_data has finished updating the JSON file,
display_data is called.  This is another python script that generates HTML code
for all the dynamic content of the site (ie the visitor counters, and graphs).
